#  Method Return Values

```ruby
def ask(question)
 print question
 # "gets" returns a string the user types.
  # Because the call to "gets" is the last
  # expression in the "ask" method, the
  # return value of "gets" becomes the
  # return value of "ask".
  gets 
end
```

puts "Welcome to the widget store!"
answer = ask("How many widgets are you ordering?")
puts answer # Prints whatever the user typed.


# Escape sequences
* \n skips to a new line
* \t indents text
* \" inserts double quotes
* \' inserts single quotes
* \\ inserts a backslash
* double quoted strings can hold single quote quotes
* single quoted strings can hold double quoted quotes


# string concatenation
* Joining multiple strings into a single string

# string interpolation
* Substituting values into the middle of a string
* the marker looks like so #{} contains and substitute the result into a string


# Calling methods on an object
* a "." operator to let ruby know which object you are calling on
* .length outputs the length on the string
* question mark in ruby is a way to show that the method is being called true or false
* .even? .odd? are ways to show true or false
*  you can chain methods like so
* puts "AAA".length.even? #false
* puts "AA".length.even? #true
* when chaining strings you want to make sure that the first part of the chain is correct or you will recieve an error

# cannot call the length method on an integer or even or odd on a stringth

* a class is like a blueprint
* instantces of a class
* . class
*  can get a list of methods by using ".methods"
* Have to look up documentation to find out what they are
* Ruby-doc.org
*  .chomp REMOVE NEW LINE CHARACTER ON STRINGS


# numeric types
* Fixnum is a hold a integer or a whole number
* Float is fractional number or a number that has a decimal point
*


# Math operation
* to get the proper result with decimals have to use a fixnum and integer
* a variable can be used in math operation
* u can update it by saying something like number = number +,-,/,* (a number)
* When dividing use a float and fixnum

# order precedence
* Order of operations applies to ruby
* Multiplication and Division has heigher priority than addition and subtraction
* PEMDAS applies to Ruby


# Coverting strings to numbers
* to_i converts string into numbers
* if you multiply a string it will just repeat the string

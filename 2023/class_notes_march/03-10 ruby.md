# comparison operators
*  == is equal
* != is not equal
* < greater than
* > less than
* <= less than or equal to 
* >= greater than or equal to
* comparison operators return a boolean value which is either true or false
* do not try to compare values of different classes it will result in false or if you use >, <  it will give an error
* You can do a comparision if you can convert a class to match another like so: "3".to_i == 3
* with strings comparision operators like greater than and less than are tested on the first letter and where it correlates on the alphabet

# If and Unless statements

[conditionals](./ruby_files/temp1.rb)
[conditionals](./ruby_files/temp2.rb)
[conditionals](./ruby_files/temp3.rb)
```ruby
if true
    puts "true"
    puts "additional code here"
 end
```

* if statements are for showing things are true and unless statements are for showing things are false
* when defining a method use **def then your method**  put "()" around your parameter
* make sure you set your parameter to equal a variable or string


# Boolean operators
* "||" = or returns true if the one of the values is true
* "&&" = and returns true if both are true
* "!" = Not returns the opposite of the value to its right

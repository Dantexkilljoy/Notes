# Ruby hash creation
* allow us to store things
* We use an indentifier to describe the item we wanna access
* identifier is most commonly strings, numbers, and symbols
* the identifier is a key and the item is a value
[conditionals](./ruby_files/ruby_hash.rb)
* Creating a new instaces like so : item = Hash.new or item = {}
* When creating a hash with curly braces keys and values need to be specified like so :item = {"item" => "Bread", "quantity" => 1}
* symbols can also be used like so: item = {:item => "Bread", :quantity => 1}
* Hash keys can also be numbers ex: item[1] = "Grocery Store"
* When a Hash has been created you can add new hash keys and values  like so: item["brand"] = "Treehouse Bread Company"
* if you are using symbols as keys the shorthand notation is: item = {item: "Bread", quantity: 1}

# Working with a Hash
[conditionals](./ruby_files/hash2.rb)


# Working with Hash values
* to return an **array** of values in the Hash use the values method (hash.values)
* the (has_value?) method and returns it true or false
* the (values_at) method returns the hash values of specified keys as an array
[conditionals](./ruby_files/hash_values.rb)

# Hash Methods
* hash.length  returns the number of keys in the hash
* hash.invert will return a new hash with the keys and values from the old hash
* hash.shift will remove a key and value pair from the hash and return it as an array
* hash.merge will combines the hash as an arguement to return a new hash with the two combined **hash.merge({"calories" => 100})**
* if duplicates within the hashes appear the merge method will overwrite them

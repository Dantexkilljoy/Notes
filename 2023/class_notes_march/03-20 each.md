# Each
* you can call the each method directly on an array where you dont have to count length of the array and loops it for us
* when we name the block variable choose a name that reflects what each element is
* when using each we dont have to worry about accessing the array with .at we just use that variable directly
* does not have to match the element in that variable just be discriptive with the element
``` ruby 
p "Enter at least 2 words, separated by spaces:"
user_words = gets.chomp.split
p "user_words:"
p user_words

user_words.each do |the_word|
  p the_word.capitalize
  p the_word.reverse
  p the_word.upcase
end
```

# a sneak peek why we use .each to embed 
``` ruby
<% newsfeed_photos.each do |the_photo| %>
  <div class="card">
    <img src="<%= the_photo.image_source %>">

    <p>
      <%= the_photo.caption %>
    </p>
  </div>
<% end %>
```
* code like this is what drives dozens of dynamic apps
* this pulls a list of records from database tables then loop them over and format them with a markup language

# each with index
* some rare cases where you are looping over an array and within a block
```ruby
 "Enter at least 2 words, separated by spaces:"
user_words = gets.chomp.split
p "user_words:"
p user_words

user_words.each_with_index do |the_word, the_index|
  p the_word.capitalize
  p the_word.reverse
  p the_word.upcase

  if the_index.odd?
    p "=" * 20
  end
end
```
* .each_with_index allows you to name two variables within the pipes; the first one will receive the element, and the second one will receive the index of the iteration. Within the block you can use both variables as you see fit.
